# Google Engineering Practices Documentation

# Google 工程最佳实践文档

Google has many generalized engineering practices that cover all languages and
all projects. These documents represent our collective experience of various
best practices that we have developed over time. It is possible that open source
projects or other organizations would benefit from this knowledge, so we work to
make it available publicly when possible.

Google 在很多工程和项目上有许多通用工程实践。 这里有一些最佳实践。 其他的开源项目和组织可以从这些
实践上获益，所以我们公开了他们。

Currently this contains the following documents:

## Terminology

## 术语说明

There is some Google-internal terminology used in some of these documents, which
we clarify here for external readers:

*   **CL**: Stands for "changelist", which means one self-contained change that
    has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review.
    Other organizations often call this a "change", "patch", or "pull-request".
*   **LGTM**: Means "Looks Good to Me". It is what a code reviewer says when
    approving a CL.

*   **CL**: 代表者 "changelist" 其他的可以叫 change patch pull-request

*   **LGTM**: 代表者 "Looks Good to Me" 代表着我接受了
